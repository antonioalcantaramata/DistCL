# DistCL: A Neural Network-Based Distributional Constraint Learning tool for Mixed-Integer Stochastic Optimization

DistCL extent the constraint learning methodology in stochastic mixed-integer optimization by addressing the statistical uncertainty in the response variables. 

DistCL helps practitioners in the following steps:

1. Training a neural network-based model to estimate the parameters of the conditional distribution of a given variable Y dependent on own decisions X and contextual information $\theta$
